# Create a variable called "categories" and assign it an empty array.
# Add 3 strings to the array you created, do it differently all 3 times.
# Make the array only contain unique objects (in this case, strings).
# Make a condition along the lines of "If categories has Animals and Shopping within it", if the condition is true, add "Family" to the array.
# Print all of the elements with a comma separating each of them, in alphabetical order.
# Print AND remove the first category.
# Print AND remove the last category.
# Write a conditional that checks if the array has more than 5 elements in it. If the condition is true, remove all elements.
# Hug yourself.
